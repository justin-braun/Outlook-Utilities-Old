# Outlook-Utilities

Outlook Utilities is a sample C# Outlook Add-in that provides three key functions:

1. Empty Folder Finder
    - Search for empty folders within the the entire mailbox.  This is useful for keeping things tidy especially after an AutoArchive operation has moved everything out of a folder.
    
2. Search and Move
    - This allows you to take the selected messages and move to a folder that you locate by typing some text to search for it.  This simplifies moving data to folders that might be buried within your mailbox without having to click through the folder tree.
    
3. Go To Folder
    - Type the folder you're looking for within your mailbox and you can be taken directly there.  Again, simplifies finding a place without having to crawl through a folder tree.
